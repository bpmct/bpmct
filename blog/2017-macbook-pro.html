        <h2>PopOS on a 2017 MacBook Pro</h2>
        <p>
            Running Pop!_OS on a 2017 MacBook Pro was more difficult than I had expected, so I figured I'd document my my findings in hope that it would be useful to others.
        </p>
        <h3 id="methodology"><a href="#methodology" class="anchor-link" onclick="copyLink(event, 'methodology')">#</a>Methodology</h3>
        <p>
            My methodology was to install Pop!_OS on an external SATA disk over USB3 to preserve the original 
            hard drive. This way, I can still boot from macOS if needed. I ultimately hope to boot from a 
            Thunderbolt hub versus having 2 cables plugged in.
        </p>
        <h3 id="fixing-the-installer-crash"><a href="#fixing-the-installer-crash" class="anchor-link" onclick="copyLink(event, 'fixing-the-installer-crash')">#</a>Fixing the Installer Crash</h3>
        <p>
            The installer would immediately crash when picking an install method (at the screen that shows 
            "Clean Install" or "Custom (Advanced)"). This is a known issue documented in 
            <a href="https://github.com/pop-os/distinst/issues/253#issuecomment-3756167134" target="_blank">GitHub issue #253</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The logs found in <code>/tmp/installer.log</code> showed:
        </p>
        <pre><code>probed "/dev/nvme0n2"
opening disk at /dev/nvme0n2
unable to open disk; creating new table on it
unable to probe devices: failed to create new partition table on "/dev/nvme0n2"</code></pre>
        <p>
            The issue is that the Pop!_OS installer tries to probe all available disks, including <code>/dev/nvme0n2</code>, 
            which is a proprietary Apple namespace that cannot be accessed. When the installer attempts to create a 
            partition table on it, it fails and crashes the entire installer.
        </p>
        <h4 id="workaround"><a href="#workaround" class="anchor-link" onclick="copyLink(event, 'workaround')">#</a>Workaround</h4>
        <p>
            A workaround was shared by <a href="https://github.com/tnorman42" target="_blank">tnorman42</a> in 
            <a href="https://github.com/pop-os/distinst/issues/253#issuecomment-3756167134" target="_blank">their comment on GitHub issue #253</a> 
            that resolves the installer crash. The solution involves writing a default partition table to the problematic NVMe 
            namespace that the installer can't access.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> Proceed at your own risk. This worked for me when installing Pop!_OS on a 2017 MacBook Pro.
        </p>
        <p>Open Terminal and run:</p>
        <pre><code>fdisk /dev/nvme0n2
w
q</code></pre>
        <p>
            When fdisk complains about an unrecognized partition table, type <code>w</code> to write a default partition table, 
            then <code>q</code> to quit. This creates a partition table on the dummy NVMe drive that appears on some MacBooks, 
            allowing the installer to probe it without crashing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that after applying this workaround, the installer may display incorrect drive space in the UI (showing roughly 
            1/10 of the actual capacity, like 56GB instead of 500GB). However, the installer will use the full disk size when 
            creating partitions, so this is just a display bug and doesn't affect the actual installation.
        </p>
        <p>
            This workaround unblocked the installation process and still allows booting from macOS, since macOS doesn't read 
            Linux partitions on the internal drive.
        </p>

        <p>
            WiFi was barely usable for me at first. It would sort of work, but only on 2.4GHz, and even then it was flaky.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here's the WiFi hardware and driver I was dealing with:
        </p>
        <pre><code>benpotter@pop-os:~$ lspci -nnk | grep -A3 -i network
02:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Broadcom Inc. and subsidiaries BCM43602 802.11ac Wireless LAN SoC [14e4:43ba] (rev 02)
        Subsystem: Apple Inc. BCM43602 802.11ac Wireless LAN SoC [106b:0157]
        Kernel driver in use: brcmfmac
        Kernel modules: brcmfmac</code></pre>
        <p>
            To get it working reliably, I followed rob-hills' notes and added the Broadcom config file at:
            <code>/usr/lib/firmware/brcm/brcmfmac43602-pcie.txt</code>.

            I wanted to use the Command key (Super) instead of Control on Wayland. GNOME Tweaks didn't work for this, so I
            used <a href="https://github.com/xremap/xremap" target="_blank">xremap</a>.
        </p>
        <p>My xremap config:</p>
        <pre><code>modmap:

      Super_L: Control_L</code></pre>
        <p>
            And here's a not-ideal-but-good systemd service that waits a bit so devices have time to connect before xremap starts:

            My next goal is to boot from a Thunderbolt hub (so I'm not juggling multiple cables). One guide I'm using as a
            starting point is: <a href="https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?t=439989" target="_blank">Linux Mint forum thread on Thunderbolt boot</a>.
