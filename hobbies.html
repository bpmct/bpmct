        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
            I watch a lot of YouTube videos and documentaries, but make an effort to have other hobbies as well.
        </p>
        <h3>Trips</h3>
        <p>Specifically, I like going new places and talking to people who live there. Road trips within the USA or
            traveling abroad are equally exciting to me.</p>
        <h3>Outdoorsy Shit</h3>
        <p>
            Camping, hiking, swimming, surfing, and recently birding. 🤓
        </p>
        <h3>Working Out</h3>
        <p>I play water polo, rock climb, swim, lift weights, surf, and occasionally play pickleball.</p>
        <h3>Tinkering</h3>
        <p>I like to write software, play with embedded hardware, and tinker with my homelab.</p>
        <p>Some of my recent tinker projects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tio</strong>: A WiFi-connected thermal printer with two physical buttons. Buttons can be
                programmed to do various things, such as print random poems and quotes. </li>
            <li><strong>Birding</strong>: I use old devices and ESP32-CAMs to record videos when birds come by my
                feeders. I use ZoneMinder to capture videos and BirdNET-Pi to capture and identify audio recordings of
                nearby birds.</li>
            <li><strong>Neighborhood Events</strong>: I'm working on an application that finds upcoming events
                in any neighborhood.</li>
        </ul>
