        <h2>My Job</h2>
        <p>
            I work in Product at Coder.com.
        </p>
        <h3>About Product</h3>
        <p>
            Product at Coder helps figure out what software we
            are going to develop next, such as new features,
            bug fixes, or even new products.
        </p>

        <h3>About Coder.com</h3>
        <p>
            Coder is an enterprise self-hosted cloud development environment software company. Let's break this down:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>enterprise</strong>: while we have many <a href="https://github.com/coder" target="_blank">open
                    source projects</a>, we sell software to large enterprise companies such as Discord and Goldman
                Sachs.
            <li><strong>self-hosted</strong>: we provide the software, our users run it on own servers they own (e.g.
                their datacenters) or rent (e.g. AWS).</li>
            <li><strong>cloud development environment</strong>: instead of coding directly on local desktops and
                laptops, developers can use a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cloud+development+environment"
                    target="_blank">cloud development environment</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>software company</strong>: our main revenue source is software sales. Coder is also <a
                    href="https://www.google.com/search?q=coder+funding+rounds" target="_blank">venture capital
                    funded</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Exciting Challenges</h3>
        <p>These aren't necessarily things I'm good or bad at, but instead things I enjoy working on improving.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Communication</strong>: Most of my work days are spent listening, thinking, writing, and
                talking. Probably not in that order.</li>
            <li><strong>Development</strong>: I work with smart people and unique challenges every week, leaving plenty
                of room for learning and personal development.</li>
            <li><strong>Patience</strong>: Even in a startup, most changes don't happen over just a day and they
                probably shouldn't. We take pride in our work and should encourage thoughtfulness and quality products.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Thoughts?</h3>
        <p>I like talking about my work and the space that we're in. Feel free to <a
                href="https://linkedin.com/in/bpmct" target="_blank">reach out</a> to me. Would love to talk shop or get
            feedback on what information would be helpful here.</p>
